# AI Chipsets

## Introduction

Lorem Ipsum

## Blockers:

* Complexity and cost of development
* Optimisation for specific algorithms
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  * Transformer Networks
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Call to Action

After you've read the primer and have familiarized yourself with this opportunity, you can submit an idea on how 
to solve the above blockers by filling out this <a href="/idea_submission_template">idea submission template</a> and submitting as a PR in the respective opportunity folder. 

## Brain Trust Vetting

Once you submit your idea, the <a href="#">Brain Trust</a> will conduct a sanity check to confirm your idea is:

* Possible
* Feasible
* Worthwhile
* Legal
* Not already explored

In order for your idea to be considered for the value proposition phase, we will need at least three approvals from the <a href="#">Brain Trust</a>

## Value Proposition

Value proposition is created by the Brain Trust & Sig Maintainers

(This will be outside of the github workflow in the form of an official presentation)

## Setting up the Project once approved

Once the value proposition has been approved (and funded, where applicable), a SIG member will create a dedicated folder for your project. 

### Ideas on how to manage this
* Use of github projects to provide agile-like features to track sprints, backlog of work, and delegate defined problem statements for the
open source community to help solve
* If this is overkill, we can simply let each team decide how to manage their own projects, but we enforce a regular update cadence in the 
form of a <a href="#">template</a>.

### If we do decide to go down the project route

* TBD (don't want to get ahead of myself if this won't be possible within the finos/zenith repo)

## Demo

(This will be outside of the github workflow in the form of an official presentation)

## Source Release & Maintenance

Defer to the OS Experts on how best to do this

Ideas include:
* putting any/all artifacts (including multimedia of demo showcase, original opp, original idea submission, and a link to where the source 
code lives, to encourage inspriration and transparency for other innovators)
